Architectural decision for refactoring from monolith to microservice architecture

I decided to use this architecture approach because while analyzing the monolithic application, 
I noticed it would be better to use gRPC messaging schemas on-location service since we will be expecting a lot of data traffic from users mobiles devices location, 
in conjunction with asynchronous message technology like Kafka for better frow with the Postgres databases.
